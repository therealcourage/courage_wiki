	<P>We interrupt this program to bring you "Courage the Cowardly Dog" show, starring Courage, the cowardly dog! Abandoned as a pup, he was found by Muriel, who lives in the middle of Nowhere with her husband, Eustace Bagge. But creepy stuff happens in Nowhere. It's up to Courage to save his new home!</P>

		<p>— The Nowhere Newsman, in the opening title sequence<P>
<p>Courage the Cowardly Dog follows Courage (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Grabstein">Marty Grabstein</a>), a kind yet easily frightened troublesome dog. He was abandoned as a puppy after his parents were sent into outer space by a crazed veterinarian.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-Remembrance_of_Courage_Past-2">2</a>] Soon after, he was found in an alleyway by Muriel Bagge (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thea_White  ">Thea White</a>), a friendly Scottish woman who decided to take Courage in as her own, and was inspired by the nature of this first meeting to give him his name. In the present, he lives with the now elderly Muriel and her husband Eustace Bagge (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Wilson_(voice_actor)">Lionel Wilson</a> in episodes 1–33, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Anderson_(actor)">Arthur Anderson</a> in episodes 34–52), a cranky and greedy American man who is often jealous of Courage and refers to him as "stupid dog", and frequently uses a mask to scare him out of his wits in an isolated farmhouse: the nearest town to the farmhouse is a town called Nowhere.</p>

<p>Courage and his owners frequently encounter monsters, aliens, zombies, and other paranormal or supernatural creatures that are attracted to Nowhere. The plot generally uses conventions common to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film">horror films</a>. Although most of the creatures the three face are hostile, some only appear that way, but are simply suffering from distress, anger, and/or acting in desperation, and sometimes because they are depressed, but they can turn out to be friendly to them.</p>

<p>The task of protecting Muriel and Eustace from such dangers falls on Courage, who endeavors to thwart or reconcile with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain_of_the_week">monster of the week</a> and remedy or repair any damages done. Although Courage is occasionally aided with that task, the full extent of his efforts is usually performed unbeknownst to Muriel and Eustace. Ironically, given his name, Courage may be considered a genuine hero who often goes to great lengths to protect his owners, and a genuine coward who still expresses much of his distress with over-the-top, piercing shrieks.</p>

<p>Although episodic in nature, there are a handful of recurring characters in the show's cast, including Courage's sarcastic, sentient computer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Prebble">Simon Prebble</a>); the family physician Dr. Vindaloo (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Schoeffler">Paul Schoeffler</a>); a fortune-telling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_(dog)">chihuahua</a> named Shirley the Medium (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Testa">Mary Testa</a>); Eustace's mother "Ma" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Lou_Watt">Billie Lou Watt</a>); villains Katz and Le Quack (both voiced by Schoeffler), and the antagonistic Di Lung.</p> <br>
<h3> Production </h3>
<hr>
<p> <b>Creation</b> </p>
<p>Originally, <i>Courage the Cowardly Dog</i> was created as a seven-minute animated short, "The Chicken from Outer Space". Dilworth started the animated short with Hanna-Barbera, sponsored by Cartoon Network and introduced Courage.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-Miller-3">3</a>] Dilworth graduated with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Fine_Arts">Bachelor of Fine Arts</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Visual_Arts">School of Visual Arts</a> in New York in 1985. He became an art director and founded his own animation studio, Stretch Films in 1991, and incorporated in 1994.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-Miller-3">3</a>] The character of Courage grew out of an earlier character of Dilworth's called Hamilton, who appeared in Smart Talk with Raisin, a pilot Dilworth created for MTV.</p>

<p>The animated short was shown as one of the episodes of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons in 1996, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> Cartoons innovation by then-president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Seibert">Fred Seibert</a>. The short served as a de facto pilot for the future series.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-Strike-4">4</a>] The original animated short had no dialogue except for one line spoken by Courage, who had a more authoritative voice akin to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Mason">Jackie Mason</a> than in the series. It was uttered by voice actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hoffman">Howard Hoffman</a> who also provided all the other vocal sounds and effects for the short.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-Miller-3">3</a>] An alien chicken was the villain in this short, who later reappears in the series to seek revenge. His sons also attempt to seek revenge in an even later episode.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-5">5</a>] The short was nominated for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Animated_Short_Film">Academy Award</a> for Best Animated Short Film at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68th_Academy_Awards">68th Academy Awards</a>, but lost to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_and_Gromit">Wallace and Gromit</a> short film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Close_Shave">A Close Shave</a>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-6">6</a>]</p>

<p> <b>Sound design</b> </p>
<p>When deciding on sound effects, Dilworth tried to avoid pre-made stock sounds.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-Miller-3">3]</a> He contributed a substantial amount of new material to sound designer Michael Geisler[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-7">7</a>] and only looked for sounds that made him laugh. The composition of the series' music relied on what was being portrayed: suspense, comedy, or action. The production crew worked together to come up with new music for the series that had not previously been used. There were a few sections on one particular piece that Dilworth exceptionally liked.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-Miller-3">3</a>] The production crew was able to isolate these sections and expand them into a usable theme.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-Miller-3">3</a>]</p>

<p>Original music featured in <i>Courage the Cowardly Dog</i> was composed by Jody Gray[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-8">8] and Andy Ezrin.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-Sporn-9">9</a>][<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-Hollywood_Reporter-10">10</a>] Classical music can be heard at times, which pays homage to classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.">Warner Bros</a>. animation and the scores of Carl Stalling.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-11">11</a>] In several episodes, Gray arranged various famous classical pieces, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner">Wagner</a>'s "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_of_the_Valkyries">Ride of the Valkyries</a>", and wrote up to 15 songs.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_the_Cowardly_Dog#cite_note-Hollywood_Reporter-10">10</a>]</p>
